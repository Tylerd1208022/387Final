@W: MT529 :"/home/ted4152/Winter24/FPGA/387Final/implmentation/sv/FIR.sv":69:4:69:12|Found inferred clock FIR|clock which controls 307 sequential elements including dotProd[31:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
